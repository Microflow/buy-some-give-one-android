## Dear Restaurant,

Do you want more business? We've built an app that promotes restaurants that mealshare.

Mealsharing is simple; For every meal you sell, you donate one meal to the homeless, or a charity, or another restaurant.

## Step 1, Create a Buy One Give One Meal Offer

## Example:

- For every pizza we sell, we'll give one tomato bread to the homeless.
- For every burrito we sell, we'll donate 30TWD to a local restaurant.
- For every salad we sell, we'll donate a pineapple juice to the local homeless shelter.

You need to calculate enough margin to make a meal for someone else. If you want to give away 50TWD, that 
must be absorbed in the cost of a 200TWD meal.

## Step 2, Post your meal offer on our subreddit.

When we see the offer, we'll post it on our app, for users to see.

Many restaurants are doing this already... Check here for some inspiration.
