# Admins: How to Choose Content

If you're reading this, you have admin access to one of the main fforward subreddits. What you post here gets seen by our users.

- Go to the 'ideas' subreddit for your city or country. 
- Find a cool article or product.
- Post it in the private subreddit for your city.

## Example

Go to fforwardIndiaIdeas, find a good article on mealsharing, post it on fforwardIndia.

## Include a mix of products, mealsharing, interesting innovations.

Readers want to see a mix of ideas, products and innovations. 

Please post one innovative idea, then one product, then one meal sharing and one trash meetup.

An example

- Tamsui trash meetup
- Local innovator trials new Tomato farm
- Happy Cow vegan restaurant meal sharing, one meal to the homeless for every meal sold.
- One hat to the homeless for every hat sold. 

Later we'll have a sort by flair feature. For now, putting it all in together will work.
